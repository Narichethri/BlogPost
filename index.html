            <p class="content1">I will start my blog with my Stay in Warangal. The now-ruined temple is located near the
                Hanamkonda-Warangal Highway. Built under
                patronage of Rudra Deva of Kakatiya dynasty, the architecture of this temple is an example of splendour.
                The richly carved pillars fetch awe-stuck tourists to its door. The thousand pillars are constructed in
                such a calculated way that the view to the shrine is not obstructed from any angle in front. We were
                astonished at the intrinsic Jaali work inside the temple and the monolithic dolerite Nandi outside of
                the temple. It is on UNESCO list of World heritage sites.</p>

        <p>During the period of the mighty Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva, General Recherla Rudra Reddy built this
            magnificent Shiva temple for Lord Ramalingeswara. The structure of the temple is unique – built on a star
            shaped pedestal which is close to 6-7 feet high. It is said that due to its beautiful star-shaped structure,
            Marco Polo lauded this temple as “the brightest star in the galaxy of temples”. The aura of the temple is
            overwhelming specially when visited early morning. The sprawling garden around the temple is very well-kept
            and there are lot of eateries outside of the temple premises for visitors.</p>

        <h2>3. Laknavaram Lake</h2>

        <img src="lake2.jpeg" alt="image">

        <p>The lake is formed by the construction of a dam on the Laknavaram River, which is a tributary of the Godavari
            River. The dam not only serves as a water source for irrigation purposes but also adds to the scenic beauty
            of the area. The serene ambiance and the panoramic views of the lake attract nature lovers and photography
            enthusiasts.
            Laknavaram lake is more popular than the Ramappa lake or Pakhal lake. Spread over 10,000 acres, this lake
            holds about about 2.135 tmcft of water. The lake is primary source for irrigation as it irrigates over 3,500
            acres of land. Built by Kakatiya kings, the lake has about 3 islands in it</p>
